Project \#2:

Visualize Me, Captain!

Initial project description:

General Concept:

Using data from individual workout activities, create a dashboard to
explore performance statistics. We will leverage visualizations to
enhance user understanding of their workout performance. Heart rate and
speed are examples of the type of data we will leverage.

We intend to use jQuery as our additional library not covered in class.
